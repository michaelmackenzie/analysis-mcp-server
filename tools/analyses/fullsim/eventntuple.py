"""Reading the EventNtuple (EventNtuple/ntuple) for full-simulation analyses.

The branch set is RefAna/pyCount's (process.py AnaProcessor.branches), less
the ones only its comparison plots use, read into the same groups so the cut
code reads like the original: data["trk"]["trk.nactive"],
data["trkfit"]["trksegs"], data["crv"]["crvcoincs.time"], ...

Shapes: "evt" is per event; "crv" is events x coincidences; "trk" is
events x tracks; "trkfit" is events x tracks x segments; "trkmc"'s trkmcsim
is events x tracks x sim particles (the track's particle first, then its
ancestors).
