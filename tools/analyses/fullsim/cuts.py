"""The CE-like track selection: pyfitter's cut-set 80 (config.py '80_1d',
cuts as analyze.py Analyze.define_cuts applies them).

Every cut is a track-level mask (events x tracks). A cut on a segment
quantity applies at one surface, as in pyfitter:
`ak.all(~at_surface | condition, axis=-1)`, so a track with no segment there
passes it vacuously and `has_trk_front_seg` is what requires one. An
event-level cut (the trigger, the calorimeter energy) is broadcast to the
event's tracks.

The cuts and their order are pyfitter's, so the cut flow lines up with its
cutflows/*.csv. Where pyfitter's code and its intent differ, this follows
what the code does on today's EventNtuple: the upstream and multi-track
vetoes ask for trk.t0, which pyfitter never reads, so they fall back to the
tracker-front segment times (the first one, and the mean, respectively).
DEFAULT_CUTS is pyfitter's switch set less its fit ranges: in_mom_range and
within_t0 are there to enable, but here the momentum window is scanned and
the time window is the time_window parameter.
