"""Energy deposition: the EdepAna analyzer (fcl/edep.fcl).

Average calorimeter and tracker energy deposition per event and per generated
event, plus the number and rate of events passing a configurable selection.
The averages come from the summary block EdepAna prints at endJob; the
selection is applied to the per-event TTree it writes (EDepAna/tree). The
module lives in Offline (Offline/Analyses/src/EdepAna_module.cc, from
v13_39_00), so it comes with the configured Musing or its backing. Offline
PR #2067 (merged 2026-10-27) added approximate hit counts from detector steps
to it; they are reported only where the configured Offline has them (see
`run`).

This module also owns the reading of that tree — `read_edep_tree` and
`EDEP_VARIABLES` — so every analysis of EdepAna output selects events the
same way, with the same variable names.
