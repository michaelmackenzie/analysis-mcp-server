"""Running a mu2e job — the part every analysis shares.

No analysis-specific knowledge lives here: callers supply an fcl and get back
the job's output. `mu2e` exists only after the Offline environment is set up,
so every job runs in a fresh bash that sets it up first, rather than assuming
the server process inherited anything. Which code that is — a muse work area,
a Musing, or a code tarball — is `mu2e_env`'s business; this module asks it
for the commands and for where the fcl lives.
