Plain Python — no MCP imports. The type hints, Field constraints, and

    """Run one analysis over its input file(s) and return its metrics.

    Call `list_analyses` first if you are unsure of the `analysis` name, the
    parameters it needs, or which metrics it reports; the metrics land in
    `metadata` under the names listed there.

    What happens depends on the analysis' `input_kind`:

    * "art_files" runs a real mu2e job (`mu2e -c <fcl> -s <file>`, or `-S` with
      a generated file list for several inputs). Expect seconds to many
      minutes. Metrics cover the whole input set as ONE job, not one result per
      file — run the tool once per file if you need per-file numbers.
    * "root_file" runs a Python computation over a ROOT file, which is fast.
      Feed it a path from the producing analysis' `files` output, or the
      production file `input_hint` describes. One whose `takes_data_files`
      is true also takes several, and combines them into one result.

    Args:
        analysis: Which analysis to run (see list_analyses), e.g. "edep".
        output_dir: Directory the analysis runs in and writes to — job output,
            logs, figures. Created if missing, and safe to reuse: a rerun
            overwrites the previous run's output rather than failing. Use a
            fresh directory per run only when you want the outputs kept apart.
        data_file: One input file: an absolute path, or the name of a file
            registered in SAM or metacat (e.g. "nts.mu2e.CeMLeadingLogMix1BB.
            MDC2025au_best_v1_1-001.001430_00000000.root", or as a DID
            "mu2e:<name>"), which is located in dCache for you. Pass exactly
            one of data_file, data_files or dataset — or none, for an
            analysis that lists `default_inputs` (e.g. the trigger rate and
            timing default to mu2e-trig-config's pileup sample).
        data_files: Several input files, each an absolute path or a
            registered file name as for data_file, analyzed together into
            one result: one mu2e job for "art_files" analyses, combined
            histograms for a "root_file" analysis that takes them (see
            `takes_data_files` in list_analyses).
        dataset: A catalogued dataset whose files are the input, located in
            dCache: a SAM definition name (e.g. "nts.mu2e.
            CeMLeadingLogMix1BB.MDC2025au_best_v1_1.root") or a metacat
            dataset DID ("<namespace>:<name>"). A bare name not defined in
            SAM is looked up in metacat under its owner's namespace. Disk
            copies are preferred to tape, and a run whose tape files are not
            staged is refused with the command that stages them. The files
            run together as with data_files.
        max_files: With dataset only: use the first this many files, by
            name. Needed for a dataset over 2000 files; useful for a quick
            check.
        parameters: Analysis-specific physics knobs, e.g.
            {"sig_eff": 2.5e-4} for approx_ce_sensitivity. list_analyses reports
            each analysis' parameters, defaults, and which are required.
        max_events: Process at most this many events (mu2e --nevts). Only for
            "art_files" analyses; useful for a quick check before a full run.
            CAUTION: generated-event counts come from the input's subrun
            bookkeeping and cover the whole file either way, so any
            "per gen event" metric is meaningless when this is set.
        timeout_s: Kill the job if it runs longer than this many seconds.
            Raise it when passing many files.
